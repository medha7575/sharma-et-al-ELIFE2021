This code reconstitutes Arp 2/3 actin cap in silico.
It has 6 different files dividing the different functionalities in smaller sections, but to run the simulation only two files needs to be run:
1. SetUp_Initiate: the initiation file, which calls all the initiation functionalities to set up the simulation enviornment and
2. Simulate_CombinedModel: which runs the simulation and calls the respective functionalities to calculate forces and update the actin nodes.
