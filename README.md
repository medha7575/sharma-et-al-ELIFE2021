This repository contains all the MATLAB files corresponding to my paper, "Emergence of a smooth interface from growth of a dendritic network against a mechanosensitive contractile material".
The respository is devided into three parts, each corresponding to distinct models : Actomyosin Only Model, Actin Cap Only model, and the Combined model with interface interaction rules. Please read the respective "ReadMe" files for details about each model in the respective folders.
